Delivery Delay Prediction using Machine Learning
# Transit Time Analysis - Delivery Delay Prediction

## Problem Statement
Predict whether a shipment will be delayed based on logistics data.

## Approach
- Performed data exploration
- Engineered transit time and time-based features
- Applied Label Encoding
- Split data into train and test sets
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression.

## Feature Importance
Transit_Time_Hours was the most important feature.

## Future Improvements
- Remove data leakage
- Add more real-world features
- Use advanced models like XGBoost
